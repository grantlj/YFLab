YF105's Smart Home Project

This repository is the implemention of the JaveEE server for a Smart Home Project. The WebServer can not only address user's 
monitoring request(temperature, humidity, smoke, infrared control, etc) from their browsers, but also the core part to communicate
with hardware(STM32 MCU) and other real-time sensors.
